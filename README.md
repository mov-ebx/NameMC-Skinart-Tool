# NameMC Skinart Tool

## 📜 Description

This is a Python script that splits up a 72x24 image into 26 Minecraft skins you can use to display images on the NameMC platform.

## ⚠️ Alternatives

I started this after my friend showed off some of his skinart to me, and I wanted to make a program to help me make my own!

If you want an easier to use version of this that doesn't require Python or anything like that, please just use Thomas' website, it's way easier.

## 🎲 How to use

### Step 1) Create your skin art

Create a 72x24 pixel image, and dont use the first 8x8 pixels.

Example:

<img width="520" src="assets/skinart.png">

### Step 2) Run the Python script

Save skin art as "`map.png`" in same directory as "`create.py`"

<img width="320" src="assets/process.png">

Run "`create.py`" and voila, your skinart will be processed in the "`skins`" directory.

### Step 3) Apply your skins on NameMC

Apply all the skins in the "`skins`" directory, starting from 26 to 1.

In-between each skin, apply your NameMC profile until the skin is there.

## Step 4) profit..?
